# Emerging Technologies

## Overview
This repository is a project demonstrating my understanding of new technologies we have covered in the Emerging Technology module.

## About the Project
The project had a number of requirements that needed to be fulfilled in order to complete the tasks at hand.  
I was required to create two Jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn and quantum-deutsch.  
Both of these notebooks should have the ability to be ran using Docker, this enables someone to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration.

### scikit-learn.ipynb
This notebook should contain:
1. Overview of scikit-learn Python library.
2. Demonstrations of at least three scikit-learn algorithms.
3. Appropriate plots and other visualisations.

### quantum-deutsch.ipynb
This notebook should contain:
1. Comparison of quantum computing and classical computing.
2. Explanation of Deutsch's algorithm with code that is simulated using qiskit
There are two Jupyter notebooks in this repository:
1. Scikit-Learn - Contains overview of scikit-learn Python library and also demonstations of at least three scikit-learn algorithms.
2. Quantum-Deutsch - Contains comparison of quantum computing and classical computing, also an explanation of Deutsch's algorithm using qiskit to simulate it with code.

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)
Python is a general purpose and high level programming language. This means that it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problem.

### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
Jupyter notebooks (or “notebooks”, all lower case) are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc…). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

### [Jupter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)
Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism and machine learning. Jupyter Lab runs in a single tab, with sub-tabs displayed within that one tab, Jupyter Notebook opens new notebooks in new tabs. So JupyterLab feels more like an IDE.

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. This will allow anyone to run my notebooks from anywhere with minimal configuration.

### [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
Pandas is a widely-used data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides numerous functions and methods that expedite the data analysis and preprocessing steps.

### [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/)
Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy. As such, it offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB. Developers can also use matplotlib's APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications.

### [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.

### [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)
StatsModels is a Python library built specifically for statistics. Statsmodels is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, but it contains more advanced functions for statistical testing and modeling that you won't find in numerical libraries like NumPy or SciPy.

### [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
Plotly enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash.

### [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
SciPy in Python is an open-source library used for solving mathematical, scientific, engineering, and technical problems. It allows users to manipulate the data and visualize the data using a wide range of high-level Python commands. SciPy is built on the Python NumPy extention.
